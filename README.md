# Non Negative Invertible Bimodal Weibull

The Weibull distribution is one of the most used models in statistics and applied areas, as it has
a simple expression for the probability density function, survival function, and moments. However,
the Weibull distribution is not able to fit bimodal data. In this work, we propose a new
generalization of the three-parameter Weibull distribution, a new invertible bimodal Weibull
model (NIBW), which can be bimodal and its cumulative distribution function and quantile
function have a simple and closed form, which makes it very interesting in simulation procedures
and for the calculation of risk measures in the applied areas. Several properties of the
model were studied and the non-negative version of the model (NNIBW) was used in the performance
of the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters and tested using Monte Carlo
simulation. Furthermore, using four sets of temperature data, we fitted and compared our model
with another bimodal distribution, calculate the return time and fit as well a regression model
for one chosen dataset.
